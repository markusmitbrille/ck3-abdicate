 abd.0001.t: "Fit To Rule"
 abd.0001.desc: "I look upon the crowd gathered in my throne room, chief among them my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', ROOT.Char.GetPlayerHeir)], [ROOT.Char.GetPlayerHeir.GetTitledFirstName]. Should I choose to go through with this, we will fight until second blood, [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan] against [ROOT.Char.GetPlayerHeir.GetWomanMan], until no further doubt remains who is most fit to rule."
 abd.0001.a: "Bark the challenge."
 abd.0001.a.win: "You win the duel"
 abd.0001.a.win.tt: "[THIS.Char.GetPlayerHeir.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] is disinherited."
 abd.0001.a.lose: "You lose the duel"
 abd.0001.a.lose.tt: "[THIS.Char.GetPlayerHeir.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] succeeds you."
 abd.0001.b: "Maybe another day."

 abd.0002.t: "Fit To Rule"
 abd.0002.desc: "It seems this old wolf still has teeth. Even after all I've taught [ROOT.Char.GetPlayerHeir.GetHerHim], my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', ROOT.Char.GetPlayerHeir)] wasn't able to beat me in combat. While [ROOT.Char.GetPlayerHeir.GetSheHe] is licking [ROOT.Char.GetPlayerHeir.GetHerHis] wounds, word is already spreading that [ROOT.Char.GetPlayerHeir.GetTitledFirstName] is not worthy of the family name, much less the right to rule our lands — neither now, nor ever."
 abd.0002.ok: "Unfortunate."

 abd.0003.t: "Fit To Rule"
 abd.0003.desc: "Bested by my own [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', ROOT.Char.GetPlayerHeir)], I sink to my knees. In a horrible moment of uncertainty, [ROOT.Char.GetPlayerHeir.GetFirstName] looms over me — one strike is all it would take to claim [ROOT.Char.GetPlayerHeir.GetHerHis] inheritance without any loose ends. Instead [ROOT.Char.GetPlayerHeir.GetSheHe] offers me [ROOT.Char.GetPlayerHeir.GetHerHis] hand and helps me up."
 abd.0003.ok: "The [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] is alive, long live the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]!"

 abd.0004.t: "Retire"
 abd.0004.desc: "My [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', ROOT.Char.GetPlayerHeir)] has been ruling by my side for a long time. While it isn't customary, it would not disrupt the government of the realm, if I were to retire from active rule. [ROOT.Char.GetPlayerHeir.GetHeShe] would simply assume full control, while I remain at court to provide guidance and moral support."
 abd.0004.a: "I have made my decision."
 abd.0004.b: "Maybe another day."

 abd.0005.t: "Exile"
 abd.0005.desc: "If I were to remain at court, my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', ROOT.Char.GetPlayerHeir)] could never rule without [ROOT.Char.GetPlayerHeir.GetHerHis] every word being weighed, [ROOT.Char.GetPlayerHeir.GetHerHis] reign in my shadow.\n\nI see no other way than to leave [ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] and retire to the road. While I depart to journey the world, [ROOT.Char.GetPlayerHeir.GetTitledFirstName] will remain here and rule."
 abd.0005.a: "I have made my decision."
 abd.0005.b: "Maybe another day."
